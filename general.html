                    <p style="font-size: 1vw;">
                        “Brexit” is a word that describes the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. June 2016, Britain voted in favor of exiting the European Union.
                        The official date for the exit of Britain is on March 29th, 2019. However, it is argued that the United Kingdom can stop the exit through a unilateral decision from its government.
                        The legality of this procedure is disputed, but it allows for the UK a way out if they decide the exit is not the optimal decision. One of the main voting issues was on immigration.
                        hey are executing therefore Article 50, which is an article in the EU for any country that wishes to exit. According to BBC, created as a part of the Treaty of Lisbon, "all it states is that
                        must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, and that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend the period - and finally, that the exiting state
                        cannot play a part in EU internal discussions about its departure."
                        Britain was pushing for more nationalistic, stricter immigration policies. While being in the EU, the UK faced a lot of immigration from its neighboring countries.
                        In an attempt to minimize immigration to focus on its own citizens, the UK’s decision for brexit is logical. In terms of the current short-term macroeconomic effects,
                        Britain has seen a negative trend. British income dropped to between 0.6 - 1.3% across the country. UK’s GDP saw a loss of 1.3%, and businesses are facing uncertainty.
                        The long term predictions are similar. The general consensus agrees that through less foreign investment, less immigration, and new trade barriers, Brexit will inevitably cause a decline in UK’s economy.

                    The date for the exit was declared for March 29th, 2019 when a referendum was held on June 23, 2016 to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.
                    This has lead to the former Prime Minister of Britain, David Cameron, to resign, which he said he would do if he lost the vote (to remain). Theresa May replaced him and is now the current
                    Prime Minister.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Article 50 process lasts two years, and EU law still stands in the UK until its formal leave in 2019. As many treaties and agreeements from all the past years need to be
                    clarified, along with the fact that a leave from the EU has never happened, inevitably the leave for the UK will be a very complicated and thorough process.
