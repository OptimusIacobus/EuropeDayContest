                    <p>
                        Opposition to the membership in the EU has existed within the British people ver since the United Kingdom joined in the 1970s.<br />
                        It has remained substantial ever since, being somewhere between 30% and 60%, and has fluctuated to that maximum in recent years.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the EU began to experience a rapid amount of immigration, support for an exit from the EU significantly increased.
                        <!-- TODO: Research the Eurozone debt crisis and if there waws an economic crisis -->
                        Support for an exit was also influenced by the Eurozone debt crises - with mass unemployment across Southern Europe, because these countries
                        were heavily in debt. Therefore, because Britain was in the EU, the country was partially responsible for helping the other counries in debt.
                        This made British citizens angry for having to carry the burden of supporting other countries because they were in the European Union.

                        A very huge factor that plays in the constant support of a secession from the EU is the sense of European identification in the UK. The UK
                        really stands out, as it is rankd 28 out of 28 for European identity - it is also rated first for the percentage of people that identify as "nation only."<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, the UK Independence Party in light of mass immigration patterns to the UK grew in success in recent years.
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the 2015 general election the Part gained nearly 4 million votes - 13% of votes cast</li>
                            <li>while they lost that same amount of votes, they have continued to campaign for Brexit.</li>
                            <li>they were joined in their call for an exit by about half the conservative party's MPs, and several Labour MPs too.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The UK Independence part gave many reasons why Britain's best interest would be to enact Brexit.
                        They said that the EU imposed too many rules on business and that the return for the expensive fees of membership was far too small.
                        Immigration, again, led the Party to advocate for Britain to takefull control of its borders, and reduce the number
                        of people coming to live and/or work.
